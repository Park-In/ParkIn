- Most households with parking lot owners leave everyday in the morning to pursue their jobs, studies, appointments ...etc, which leaves those parking lots empty and without use for around 9 hours daily. Also lots of public parking lots are unknown to people which make them unusable if people don’t know about them.


- In response ParkIn comes to allow those owners to offer those parking lots for rent and get paid per period of time by others who’re looking for a place to park safely and in time.

- Our business model revolves around parking lot owners getting paid for providing their unused parking lots for a certain amount of cash per period of time provided, which will allow individuals to find a parking lot near their destination with ease and prior of time, without missing out on your important schedule or getting a ticket for illegal parking.

- Given that a user opens the application in their mobile they will be introduced with the applications landing page Then the application will allow them to know more and navigate through the pages with easy accessability.
